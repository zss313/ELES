# SSN: Shift Suppression Network for Endogenous Shift of Photovoltaic Defect Detection

Electroluminescence (EL) Endogenous Shift (ELES) dataset is the first endogenous domain shift benchmark of photovoltaic manufacturing scenarios. Due to the differences in intrinsic mechanisms or hardware components of the imaging systems of different types of imaging conditions, there are subtle perturbations in EL images generated by different quality inspection production line, which cause the endogenous shift.
